Leave atleast three blank spaces/lines.  
First write your github username between two **.  

THen leave one blank space/line anon the next line type in the contribution changes that you have done between two "".  Its alright to make it
more than one line, but just make shure it is between the two "".  

Then again leave one blank space/line and on the next line type a SHORT discription of what changes you made and WHY have you made those
 changes.  Make shure that these are typed in between the two ++.  Its allright to make more than one line, but just make shure that it is
  between the two ++.  
 
 Not doing any/some of the above will cause an automatic reversal of your contributions.  You will also make me mad.
